        <p>
            Welcome to E-Bookstore. Your privacy is important to us, and we are committed to
            protecting your personal information. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, disclose, and
            safeguard the data you share with us when you use our website and services.
        </p>
        <p>
            When you register on our platform or interact with our website, we may collect personal information such
            as your name, email address, phone number, and mailing address. Additionally, we may gather information
            about your interactions with our site, including your IP address, browser type, operating system, and the
            pages you visit. To enhance your experience, we also use cookies—small files stored on your device—to track
            your preferences and analyze website usage.
        </p>
        <p>
            The information we collect is used to process your registration, deliver our services, and personalize your
            experience. We may also use it to communicate with you regarding updates, promotional offers, and customer
            support. Furthermore, we use this data to ensure the security of our platform and comply with applicable
            legal requirements.
        </p>
        <p>
            We do not sell your personal information. However, we may share your data with trusted service providers
            who assist us in operating our platform. In compliance with the law, we may also disclose your information
            when required to respond to legal obligations or protect the rights of our users and ourselves.
        </p>
        <p>
            To protect your personal data, we implement industry-standard security measures. While we strive to keep
            your information safe, please note that no method of data transmission or storage is entirely secure.
        </p>
        <p>
            As a user, you have certain rights regarding your personal data. You can access and update your information,
            opt out of specific communications, and request the deletion of your data where permissible by law. If you
            wish to exercise these rights, please contact us at E-Bookstore@gmail.com.

        <p>
            We are committed to being transparent about how we use your information. For instance, cookies are small
            text files placed on your device that allow us to remember your preferences, improve our website, and

        <p>
            When sharing your data with third parties, we ensure they uphold the same level of security and privacy
            standards. For example, we may share limited information with email service providers to deliver newsletters
            or marketing materials. Such sharing is strictly for operational purposes and is done with your privacy in
            mind.
        </p>
